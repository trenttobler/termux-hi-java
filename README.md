# Termux : building and running java code

This repository is an example of building and running java code, on an Android device.

The code is just a simple "hello world" java proof of concept.

To verify, ensure all termux packages are installed, and then type 'make' which builds, and then
runs the sample code.

Environment used to verify / demonstrate:

	termux 0.106 (android / FDroid store)

	termux package versions (pkg install ___)
		coreutils 8.32-7
		termux-tools 0.113
